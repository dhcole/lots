It's a previewer! Clone it, open `index.html`, and type a project name
and click 'start'.

**Columns** are filled with **maps**. Each **column** of maps
share the same centerpoint, but each map in the column can have
a different zoom level.

It's useful for complex map design, where you're making sure that
z0, z3, z5, or any other bunch of zoom levels all look good with
a worldwide style - you can have a column for Berlin, one for
New York, etc.

Also, it's hooked up to [TileMill](http://mapbox.com/tilemill)'s
changes feed, so when you save the map style in TileMill, it'll
update all of your maps in lots.

It's inspired by [Mike Migurski's](http://mike.teczno.com/)
make scripts that generate images on static HTML. This version
has interactive maps with Modest Maps.
